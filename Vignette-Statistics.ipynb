    "\n",
    "Statsmodels is python's most fully featured statistical module. It provides access to a wide range of statistical models, tests and descriptive tools. We're going to use this module to conduct some simple statistical analysis using hypothesis tests and regresison analysis. However, it is worthwhile acknowledging that python's statistical capabilities are less well developed that statistical software like STATA or R, however they are developing rapidly. Currently, you will get a sense that performing some analyses is harder than it should be, simply because less time has been dedicated to the task than with more mature modules like pandas (which is itself still in active development).\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, this makes both python generally and statsmodels in particular exiting to use, as functionality is continually evolving!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the majority of undergraduate degree-level statistics in statsmodels: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html (scroll down the webpage for module contents), it's mostly in areas like complex survey analysis and sophisticated modelling approaches where it falls behind compared to STATA or R.\n",

    "In this vignette we'll be using a new dataset, the 'Quarterly Labour Force Survey, January - March, 2015'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is  to provide information on the UK labour market that can then be used to develop, manage, evaluate and report on labour market policies.\n",

This is a special pandas datatype for storing categorical data - data that have a limited number of possible values (categories). Previously, our categorical data was simply represented as 'object' (text/string) data, however the category datatype formalises the distinction between text data, which can take an effectively unlimited set of values, and categories which usually have a fixed set of possible values.\n",

    "\n",
    "The categorical data type can store either nominal (unordered) or ordinal (ordered) data. Nominal categories have no specific order to them, and store information like ethnic group membership, by constrast ordinal categories have an implicit order, age groups, for instance, ascend for younger groups to older groups, while a categorical measure of disease severity might have three ordered categories: low, medium and high.\n",

    "The Labour Force Survey is not a simple random sample, it has a complex survey design (like most contemporary surveys). The LFS is a geographically stratified random sample, with participants drawn at random from the postcode address file (PAF; a list of c.97% of private households in GB) and supplemented with some other methods. The survey approach means that members of some population groups have a different chance of being selected to participate in the survey than members of other groups. It also has some differences in response rate between population groups, some people were more likely to actually choose to take part than others. This means that statistics produced for the raw data are not necessarily generalisable to the population as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to produce information that does generalise to the general population, or the population of interest for a particular survey, weights are produced that adjust the influence of each respondent relative to the overall population. In the LFS, cross-sectional weights account for age, sex and region of participants, adjusting to Census-based estimates of population. It is also possible to use the LFS as a longitudinal survey, however this application is more eadvanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Labour Force Survey teaching dataset has two weights: 'PWT14' and 'PWT14R':\n",
    "* PWT14 is a 'grossing rate', meaning that applying it produces population totals, it multiplies the data up to the estimated population of England and Wales at the time.\n",

This is useful for statistical inference where sample standard error is a function of sample size. Using the grossing weight would make the statistics produced seem much less uncertain that they really are.\n",

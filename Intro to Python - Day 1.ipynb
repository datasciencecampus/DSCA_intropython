    "# Python Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Object is the general name for data types, data structures, functions and so on that python stores in memory and references with an identifier. Technically, an object is a specific instance of a 'class', which is an abstract template for a data type, data structure etc. A class is a pattern for creating new objects that can be reused and extended.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "days_list = [\"Mon\", \"Tues\", \"Weds\", \"Thurs\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "`days_list` is the identifier for a python 'list' data structure (object) that in this case stores some text values.\n",
    "\n",
    "All objects have properties and methods, which relate to data that the object stores and behaviours (procedures) that can be performed on the object to get a specific output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing the properties and methods of an object usually means using the '.' (dot notation). This means we type the name of the object we are interested in, put a dot, then type the name of the property or method we want to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, calling the `clear()` method of a list object named `fruit` would be achieved like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit.clear()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would have the effect of removing any items stored by the list `fruit`, emptying the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we wanted to use the count method to count the number of times a particular item occured in a list, we might do the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit = ['apple','apple','banana','orange'] # create a list called fruit.\n",
    "fruit.count('apple') # count the number of times that the string 'apple' occurs in the fruit list\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above, we would expect the `.count()` method, with the parameter 'apple' to return the value 2, because 'apple' appears twice in the list `fruit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are some special in-built python functions that interact with objects and perform special behaviours, like `print()` and `len()`, or the numeric functions (e.g. `pow()`) you've seen already.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, calling the python `print()` function enables us to print a representation of an object based on how a given object behaves with respect to that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python sorted function declaration is as follows: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "sorted(iterable[, key = None][, reverse = False])\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sample_str = ['Modi', 'Trump', 'Putin', 'Jinping']\n",
    "print(\"Default sort: \", sorted(sample_str))\n",
    "print(\"Reversed sort: \", sorted(sample_str, reverse = True))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "* The python list object is (possibly) the most versatile of the built in data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can hold any sequence of objects, including mixes of objects like strings, integers and Boolean variables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists can also hold other lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They can also hold custom data structures, and can be used to create custom data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists are generally created, or 'instantiated', using square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A new list is considered to be an 'instance' of the list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each item in the list is separated by a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists can be amended (they are 'mutable' - they can be changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Technically, a string is a list of characters, this becomes clear if we explictly make it a list.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3.3 Accessing Values in Lists and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to creating list objects, python also uses square brackets as an indexing operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to access a value in a list or tuple use the square brackets and the index (position) of the value you want to obtain e.g.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vegetables= ['Carrot','Onion','Potato', 'Cauliflower']\n",
    "vegetables[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above list, the value obtained is `'Onion'` this is because python counts from zero:\n",
    "* `vegetable[0]` is 'Carrot'\n",
    "* `vegetable[1]` is 'Onion'\n",
    "* `vegetable[2]` is 'Potato'\n",
    "* `vegetable[3]` is 'Cauliflower'\n",
    "\n",
    "The same would apply if we had made a tuple instead of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are dealing with lists, you can also update the values in lists using indexing. This is because lists are mutable. e.g.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vegetables= ['Carrot','Onion','Potato','Cauliflower']\n",
    "vegetables[1] = 'Courgette'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Will give: `['Carrot',Courgette','Potato','Cauliflower']`\n",
    "\n",
    "As `'Onion'` has been updated with `'Courgette`'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways to index:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Expression | Result | Explanation\n",
    "------------------|--------|------------\n",
    "vegetables[1]     |'Courgette'| Indexing from start of list at 0\n",
    "vegetables[-2] | 'Potato' | Backwards indexing from end of list\n",
    "vegetables[2:] | ['Potato','Cauliflower'] | Slicing a section from a given start index to the end of the list.\n",
    "vegetables[:2] | ['Carrot','Courgette'] | Slicing a section from the start of the list until a given end index.\n",
